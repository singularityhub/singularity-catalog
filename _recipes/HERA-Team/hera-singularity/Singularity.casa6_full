# Definition file for a singularity container for HERA
# This container is a modern attempt to build a software stack to run
# the HERA casa_imaging pipeline. The existing IDR2 pipeline was based on
# Python 2, which has been depreciated, and all HERA software packages have
# since been moved to be Python3-only compatible. This container is largely
# similar to the `hera1` container, with an addition of a full installation
# of CASA-6, which is also based on Python 3.
