    DARACH's DEV BRANCH

    This should give you an environment to run FITseq.
    The runscript is just bash.
    Scripts are going to be in /usr/bin, and that's:

        - evo_simulator.py
        - pyfitseq.py

    Should be accessible immediately from the exec line, so something like this
    should do it:

        singularity exec fitseq_container.simg pyfitseq.py -h

%runscript

    bash

%environment

    export LANG="C.UTF-8"
