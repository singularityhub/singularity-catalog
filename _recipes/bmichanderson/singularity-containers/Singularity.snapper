	PROGRAM BEAST2, SNAPPER, SPEEDEMON
	VERSION 2.7.7, latest, latest


%help
	This container is for running SNAPPER and other packages related to species delimitation as implemented in BEAST2
	
	To use the programs in it:
		singularity exec -H "$(pwd)" snapper.sif [args]
	Example args include:
		beast input.xml
		packagemanager -list
		applauncher {app_name}
	
	Note: binding home directory is needed to prevent use of system home for creating a ~/.beast directory

	To directly run beast, use:
		singularity run -H "$(pwd)" snapper.sif [args]
