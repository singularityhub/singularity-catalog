%setup
     ## The "%setup"-part of this script is called to bootstrap an empty
     ## container. It copies the source files from the branch of your
     ## repository where this file is located into the container to the
     ## directory "/planner". Do not change this part unless you know
     ## what you are doing and you are certain that you have to do so.

    REPO_ROOT=`dirname $SINGULARITY_BUILDDEF`
    cp -r $REPO_ROOT/ $SINGULARITY_ROOTFS/planner

%post

    ## The "%post"-part of this script is called after the container has
    ## been created with the "%setup"-part above and runs "inside the
    ## container". Most importantly, it is used to install dependencies
    ## and build the planner. Add all commands that have to be executed
    ## once before the planner runs in this part of the script.

    ## Install all necessary dependencies.
    dnf upgrade -y
    dnf group install -y "Development Tools"
    dnf install -y python gcc-c++ cmake boost boost-devel glibc-static libstdc++-static clang

    ## Build your planner
    cd /planner/fast-downward-conjunctions
    ./build.py release64clangpgonative -j4

    cd /planner/fast-downward-decoupled
    ./build_all -j4

    ## Strip binaries.
    strip --strip-all /planner/fast-downward-conjunctions/builds/release64clangpgonative/bin/preprocess
    strip --strip-all /planner/fast-downward-decoupled/search/downward-release

    ## Remove packages unneeded for running the planner.
    dnf remove -y gcc-c++ cmake boost boost-devel glibc-static libstdc++-static clang
    dnf autoremove -y
    dnf clean all

    ## Only keep essential binaries (we only need the decoupled search, but
    ## translator and preprocessor of conjunctions).
    ## fast-downward-conjunctions.
    mkdir -p /compiled-planner/fast-downward-conjunctions/builds/release64clangpgonative/bin
    mkdir -p /compiled-planner/fast-downward-conjunctions/src
    mv /planner/fast-downward-conjunctions/src/translate /compiled-planner/fast-downward-conjunctions/src
