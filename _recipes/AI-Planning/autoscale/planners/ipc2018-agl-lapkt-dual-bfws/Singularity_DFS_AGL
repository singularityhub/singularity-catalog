%setup
     ## The "%setup"-part of this script is called to bootstrap an empty
     ## container. It copies the source files from the branch of your
     ## repository where this file is located into the container to the
     ## directory "/planner". Do not change this part unless you know
     ## what you are doing and you are certain that you have to do so.

    REPO_ROOT=`dirname $SINGULARITY_BUILDDEF`
    cp -r $REPO_ROOT/ $SINGULARITY_ROOTFS/planner

%post

    ## The "%post"-part of this script is called after the container has
    ## been created with the "%setup"-part above and runs "inside the
    ## container". Most importantly, it is used to install dependencies
    ## and build the planner. Add all commands that have to be executed
    ## once before the planner runs in this part of the script.
