    # Texlive installation profile:
    # You can generate your own by getting the Texlive `install-tl` script
    # as detailed below in %post, running it without arguments to get the
    # interactive mode, make your changes (I selected the installation scheme
    # "scheme-basic"), then choose the option to just save the profile to `texlive.profile`.
    # IMPORTANT: Don't forget to edit the file to make the paths match the
    # expectations in %post below, and to make them work with Singularity!

    # For Snakemake for Python 3.8 we currently need libdatrie-devel

%help
    This container can be used for running OpenFOAM fluid simulations for the Pogona macroscopic molecular communication simulator.

    Open a shell for example like so: `./cases.simg /bin/bash`.

    To run a simulation, call this container with "cd /mamoko-openfoam-cases/<case dir> && ./AllRun"
