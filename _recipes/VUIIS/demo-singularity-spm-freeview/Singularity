%help
  Demo of a singularity container that runs a Matlab program. Freesurfer's
  Freeview is also included, as it's a handy resource for figure creation.
  Info and usage: /opt/pipeline/README.md


%setup

  # Create an installation directory for the codebase. We can often finagle this
  # in the 'files' section and forgo the 'setup' section entirely, but it's 
  # clearer this way.
  mkdir -p "${SINGULARITY_ROOTFS}"/opt/pipeline


%files

  # Copy all the code into the container's installation directory. We do this in
  # specific pieces to avoid bulk copying any extra junk we might have floating
  # around in the local working copy of the repository. This Singularity recipe
  # itself is put in the container automatically during the build, at 
  # /.singularity.d/Singularity
  #
  # The Matlab source code is not actually used, because we'll run the compiled
  # version with the Matlab Runtime instead. But the source code will be in the
  # container for reference. Don't let these get out of sync, i.e. don't change
  # the Matlab source code and then forget to recompile it before building the
  # container.

  # Make sure we get the newest versions of OS packages and the package data.

  # versions of things will likely be different. We could specify particular 
  # versions below if needed - easy (if tedious) to find out what they are in an
