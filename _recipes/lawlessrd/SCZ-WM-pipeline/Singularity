  # Matlab 
  # We set Matlab's default shell, in case we call any shell commands from 
  # Matlab. We also set the runtime's installed location, as it's needed to run
  # the compiled binary - note, this must match the mcr_location specified
  # above in the 'post' section. However we don't need to set the Matlab library
  # path here, because Matlab's auto-generated run_??.sh script does it for us.

  # We add the src directory, which contains shell scripts etc; and the
